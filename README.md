MSX Related information and code examples

# MSX past
Back in the mid eighties I owned a **MSX2 computer Philips NMS8280**, and I mainly did MSX_BASIC programming. In that time I was a favorite reader of msx club magazine: https://www.msxclubmagazine.be/
I wrote some code and articles for the magazine as from 1990, one example: https://www.msxclubmagazine.be/docs/msxclubmag29.pdf

# MSX future
## MSX-VR
In fact there is a real future for the MSX computer:

Mine shipped in August 2021 and I'm already preparing myself to acquire knowledge of Basic, DOS, Z80 Assembler and of course the BIOS routines.

## MSX-3
Should arrive end 2022. https://www.timeextension.com/news/2022/09/an-msx-3-is-on-the-way-according-to-msx-co-creator-kazuhiko-nishi

# Documentation
In this repo I put some reference material from Zilog (The Z80 CPU manual) and ASCII (The MSX2 Redbook, or technical documentation).
I already have an evaluation version of the VR Programming guide that ships with the MSXVR.

# Coding
In the files and folders you'll find some coding examples.
For those that don't own a physical MSX computer, you can of course use this emulator: https://msxpen.com/ or https://webmsx.com

## VR-Script
Really looking forward to the VR-Script language that will join the MSXVR. It seems to be some kind of C++ compiler that compiles to MSX-VR or Z80 machinecode (with specific MSXLIB library) and that is aware of the MSX BIOS functions. http://msxvr.es/doc/wiki/index.html

## MSXBAS2ROM
I'm really in love with the "new" MSX-BASIC compiler MSXBAS2ROM. See the Wiki for more information. In this folder, you will find some of my early succesfull tests with this compiler ;-).
I added a folder named *Modern Game Development*, this folder contains modified examples for MSXBAS2ROM and MSX-2 from the book "Modern MSX BASIC Game Development" from Raul Portales. The examples cover topics like sprites, tiles in a modern way, and if combined could help you making a modern compiled game.

## FUSION-C
For those of you who bought the book Fusion-C version 1.1 on amazon.nl. I made a version 1.2 delta, so you can print the pages and add them to your book. Code examples of Fusion-C v1.2 will follow.
You can find some .c source code examples here. They are examples of the site of Fusion-C, but added some comments to understand them better.
I am now working on converting some "Modern MSX BASIC Game Development" examples to Fusion-C. They will be added to this repo when they are ready.
