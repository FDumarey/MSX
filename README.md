# MSX
MSX Assembler functions

# MSX past
Back in the mid eighties I owned a MSX2 computer Philips NMS8280, and I mainly did MSX_BASIC programming. In that time I was a favorite reader of msx club magazine: https://www.msxclubmagazine.be/
I wrote some code and articles for the magazine as from 1990, one example: https://www.msxclubmagazine.be/docs/msxclubmag29.pdf

# MSX future
In fact there is a real future for the MSX computer:

Mine would ship from end of October 2020 to my place and I'm already preparing myself to acquire knowledge of Basic, DOS, Z80 Assembler and of course the BIOS routines.

# Documentation
In this repo I put some reference material from Zilog (The Z80 CPU manual) and ASCII (The MSX2 Redbook, or technical documentation).

# Assembler
In the upcoming months I will make some Assembler functions than can be used to handle different tasks (mainly VDP).

## Future
Really looking forward to the VR-Script language that will join the MSXVR. It seems to be some kind of C++ compiler that compiles to Z80 machinecode and that is aware of the MSX BIOS functions. It will also do some kind of Intellisense as known in Visual Studio.
